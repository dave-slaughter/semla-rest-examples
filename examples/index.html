<h1>REST Examples</h1>
<p>Below are examples for including South Lacrosse data into other websites.</p>
<p>Please note: These examples are distributed in the hope that they will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or

<p>The recommended method to access our services is using Server Side Includes, such as the PHP samples. If
that isn't possible then there is an example of a Client Side Include which will work on any web page.</p>
<p>The PHP examples must be served from a server running PHP with the curl extension installed (this is
usually compiled in, so if your site has PHP it is very unlikely not to have curl). They also use
utilities in the httpCache.inc file, which contains code to cache data on your server, and enables
cacheing in the browser, so providing fast response times.</p>
<p>The Client Side Include version will work even if this page is opened directly on your computer.</p>
